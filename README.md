# Basic DSP with Pathway
This project implements basic digital signal processing using the Pathway library. It is designed to be run from the command line, allowing users to process audio files for dynamic compression and other DSP techniques.

> If you're reading this after reading the blog, the code has been refactored to make it feasible to run through a CLI.

## Prerequisites
* Git CLI
* Python 3.8 or higher
* An audio file to process
